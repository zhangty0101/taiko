Even fixing broken links is a big, big help!

## How do I start contributing

There are issues of varying levels across all Taiko repositories. All issues that 
need to be addressed are tagged as [help wanted](https://github.com/getgauge/taiko/labels/help%20wanted). 
One easy way to get started is to pick a small bug to fix. 
These have been tagged as [good first issue](https://github.com/getgauge/taiko/labels/good%20first%20issue).

Once you pick an issue, add a comment informing that you want to work on it. To get 
early feedback from other contributors, it's recommended that you first raise a pull 
request with a small commit by prefixing "WIP" to the pull request title. Keep making
incremental commits to this pull request and seek out help or reviews till it's complete.

You can also reach out on [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/taiko).

If your contribution is a code contribution and you do send us a pull request, please 
sign all your commits using git.
