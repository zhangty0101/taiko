Taiko comes with a recorder that’s a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop) 
for writing test scripts. Taiko's recorder generates clean, maintainable 
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) code. 

The following sections explain how to launch the recorder, automate a browser and
generate test scripts.

## Launching

Install the latest version of version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and launch the Taiko REPL in 
your favorite terminal application using

```
npx taiko
```

This launches the Taiko REPL prompt.

```
Version: 1.x.x (Chromium: XX.x.x)
Type .api for help and .exit to quit
> 
```

You start exploring and using Taiko's API. 

Taiko's REPL is a specialised wrapper
over `node` [REPL](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html#repl_the_node_js_repl) for handling 
Taiko's API. You can also Taiko's REPL to run JavaScript code or use any Node.js libraries.

## Exploring

Taiko REPL command `.api` lists all available API in
the following format (This is a shortened output)

```
> .api

Browser actions
    openBrowser, closeBrowser
    ...

Page actions
    goto, reload, goBack
    ...

...
```

For more info Taiko's API like paramters and example usage you can run `.api <api>`

```
> .api click
Fetches an element with the given selector, scrolls it into view if needed, 
and then clicks in the center of the element...

Parameters:
...

Returns: Promise

Example:
  await click('Get Started')
  ...
```

This API reference is also available [online](/api/reference).

## Running commands

To start automating the browser you can type in Taiko's API. For example
to launch a browser instance

```
> openBrowser()
```

This launches an instance of Chromium that is bundled with Taiko.

To automate this browser instance, you can use other commands 
from Taiko's API. Here's an example automating the browser to search 
Google

```
> goto("google.com")
> write("taiko test automation")
> click("Google Search")
```

These commands automate the browser to

* `goto` Google’s home page,
* `write` the text "taiko test automation" and then
* `click` on the "Google Search" button.

You can see the browser performing these actions as you type and press enter for 
each command.

## Generate code

Taiko’s REPL keeps a history of all successful commands. Once you finish an execution flow, 
generate a test script using the special command `.code`

```
> .code
```

This command generates JavaScript code.

```
const { openBrowser, goto, write, click } = require('taiko');
(async () => {
  try {
    await openBrowser();
    await goto("google.com");
    await write("taiko test automation");
    await click("Google Search");
  } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
  } finally {
    closeBrowser();
  }
})();
```

Copy/Modify this code or save it directly to a file using


```
> .code googlesearch.js
```

## Stopping

Stop and exit a recording session using

```
> .exit
```

Please note that you will lose all previous sessions recording history each\
time you launch Taiko's REPL.

## Playback

You can re-run the test scripts saved from a session using the `taiko` command

```
npx taiko googlesearch.js
```

By default this will run the script in headless mode and you will not see a browser 
instance. However, if you would like to see the browser you can run

```
npx taiko googlesearch.js --observe
```

The `--observe` command adds a delay of three seconds between each actions and highlights 
Taiko's API actions on the page under test.

## Resume

You can resume a session by using the [`repl`](/api/repl) API in your test script
and using the `--load` options while launching the Taiko REPL 

For example 

```
const { openBrowser, goto, write, click, repl } = require('taiko');
(async () => {
  try {
    await openBrowser();
    await goto("google.com");
    await write("taiko test automation");
    await click("Google Search");

    // Launchs the REPL after executing 
    // the commands above

    await repl(); 
  } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
  } finally {
    closeBrowser();
  }
})();
```

```
npx taiko --load googlesearch.js
```

## Load plugins

If you want to use Taiko [plugins](/plugins) in the REPL. You can use `--plugin <plugin>` 
option, for example to use [Taiko diagnostics](https://github.com/saikrishna321/taiko-diagnostics) 
plugin 

```
npx taiko --plugin taiko-diagnostics
> openBrowser();
> diagnostics.startTracing();
> goto('google.com');
> diagnostics.endTracing();
```

## Manage browsers

You can use the environment variable `TAIKO_BROWSER_PATH` to launch Taiko's recorder on any browser
(other than chromium version bundled with Taiko). Please follow your Operating System's instruction on 
setting environment variables. For example in `bash` or `zsh` you can try

```
TAIKO_BROWSER_PATH=/complete/path/to/browser/executable/file npx taiko
```

Note, the path should be to the browser executable file and not just the browser executable's folder.
You can point this environment variable to [chromium](https://www.chromium.org) based browsers like 
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge), 
[Opera](https://www.opera.com) etc. and [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/)

## Emulation

Taiko also has an options for emulating

* Devices
* Networks

To emulate devices (using the browser's viewport) you can use the `--emulate-device` option as follows

```
npx taiko --emulate-device 'iPhone X'
```
You can refer [devices.js](https://docs.taiko.dev/devices) for the full list of devices.

To emulate network you can use the `--emulate-network` option for example

```
npx taiko --emulate-network 'Regular2G`
```

The available options are `GPRS`, `Regular2G`, `Good2G`, `Regular3G`, `Good3G`, `Regular4G`, `DSL`, 
`WiFi`, `Offline`
